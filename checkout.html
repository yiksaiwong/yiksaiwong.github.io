				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Scrolling for unique products is easy on Touch of Modern (TOMO), an e-commerce website for modern men. However, <b>customers are not completing their checkout process, leaving us with a cart abandonment rate of 67.83%.</b>
				<br><br>
				The goal of this project was to <b>redesign the checkout flow to reduce cart abandonment rate.</b>

				<h2><img class="icon" src="images/icons/research.png">01. Research & Analysis</h2>
				<h4>😟 Problems with the Current Checkout</h4>
				<p>It has been a few years since the checkout flow has been redesigned. Since then, we’ve continuously added new features to the existing checkout despite various limitations. We analyzed our current flow and discovered the following pain points:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Screens have unique, inconsistent layout and styling</b></li> 
					<li><b>Lots of back and forth between steps</b> (more evident on mobile web)</li>
					<li><b>Lacks consideration for all use cases</b> (e.g. Users cannot use fast checkout to purchase age-restricted items or select shipping speed)</li> 
					<li><b>Incomplete typing and error checking system</b></li> 
				</ul>

					</a>
					<div class="gray fineprint">Current Checkout User Flow</div>
				</div>	
				<h4>✨ Opportunities to Improve</h4>
				<p>In order to improve the checkout process, we planned to implement the following changes after doing competitive analysis and checkout reassessment:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Create a more intuitive and linear experience</b></li> 
					<li><b>Make the checkout flow faster</b></li>
					<li><b>Remove restrictions for fast checkout</b></li>
				</ul>
				<br><br>
	
				<h2><img class="icon" src="images/icons/design.png">02. Design</h2>
				<h4>🔗 New User Flow</h4>
				<p>After determining our goals, we created a user flow outlining the main pages and steps in order to get a clearer picture of all the different use cases. We also identified the optional and required steps needed to check out.</p>
				<div class="center">

				</div>
				<h4>🧭 Explorations</h4>
				<h6 class="darkgray">Changing the Overall Layout</h5>
				<p>One key pain point of the current flow was that it requires customers to continuously reload screens to advance to the next section. This issue was especially frustrating for mobile users who had to do a lot of scrolling on top of the reloading. To solve this issue, we decided on a <b>single page flow to avoid reload time and to provide consistent layout and styling for all customers.</b> We also <b>added indicators for each checkout step to create a smooth and intuitive experience.</b></p>
				<div class="center">

					<div class="gray fineprint">Iterations for Overall Layout
					<br><br>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h6 class="darkgray">Improve Gifting Option and Apply Store Credit</h6>
				<p>The <b>current flow created a lot of back and forth</b> between steps when selecting gifting options and applying store credit. It was confusing where and when users can edit their information. This <b>inconsistency was improved through the single page checkout.</b>
				<br><br>
				</p>

					<br><br>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h6 class="darkgray">Improve Shipping and Billing Sections</h6>
				<p>Similarly, it took a lot of effort for customers to add new shipping or billing info. Selecting an existing shipping/billing is on a modal but adding a new shipping/billing requires a page reload. <b>The single page checkout helped avoid page reload, thus expediting checkout flow.</b> Additionally, we required users to type unnecessary information such as retyping their billing address even if it’s the same as their shipping address. <b>These unneeded steps were removed to also make the flow faster.</b>

					<br><br>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h6 class="darkgray">Add a Typing and Error Checking System</h6>
				<p>Upon further inspection, checkout time tended to increase when customers inputted their information incorrectly. To solve this, <b>we incorporated an address autocomplete feature, city and state autofill feature</b> (for customers who skip address autocomplete), <b>address verification feature, and an error checking system.</b> The new error checking system applied to the rest of the site as well to make it a consistent experience for customers.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<h4>🔎 User Testing</h4>
				<p>To validate our designs, we conducted 12 remote usability testing sessions with potential and existing customers. 6 were conducted on desktop web and 6 were conducted on mobile web. Each participant was asked to complete a set of common tasks and scenarios for online shoppers.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>After reviewing the testing results with the stakeholders, the users had no major difficulties going through the checkout flow. However, there were a few hiccups and confusions. Thus, we improved the following features based on user feedback:
				</p>
				<h6 class="darkgray">Autofill City and State</h6>
				<p>Customers who did not use Google address recommendation preferred filling out the Zip Code first and having it autofill City and State to save time.</p>
				<h6 class="darkgray">Rewrite Copy</h6>
				<p>While all participants were able to successfully complete the checkout flow, there was some confusion around the copy. Some were confused why the ‘Card & Other Options’ section led to the shipping section first instead of the billing section. Others were confused why we asked for a phone number in the shipping section. Due to this, we revisited the copy again to make sure all steps were clear.</p>

			<h2><img class="icon" src="images/icons/qa.png">03. Quality Assurance</h2>
			<h4>📝 User Acceptance Test</h4>
			<p>To ensure quality assurance, the design team created an initial draft of the user acceptance test plan (UAT) to list out all the functionalities and use cases. The engineering team reviewed it for clarifications before editing as needed.</p>
			<p>After the first test build was out, the designers went through the UAT to list out any UX and UI issues. A few rounds of testing is currently being done to ensure everything works smoothly.</p>

			<h2><img class="icon" src="images/icons/results.png">04. Results + Takeaways</h2>
			<h4>📊 Results</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Coming soon! Project is still in QA phase.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>💡 Lessons Learned (So Far)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Need to improve on note-taking processes since this was an extensive and time-consuming project. Many were decisions made but were not all noted.</li> 
				<li>Breaking the checkout project into sections. Instead of revamping the whole thing at once, do it in small sections. That way, if something went wrong, we know exactly which part caused it.</li>
