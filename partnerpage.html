				<h1>TOMO Partner Page Redesign</h1>
				<p>Touch of Modern (TOMO) is an e-commerce experience for modern men to discover curated, well-crafted products. We partner with a variety of brands to market and sell their incredible products on the site. The goal of this project was to redesign the existing partner page to clearly display our information to potential vendors and increase the chances of them partnering with us.</p>
				<p><b>Role:</b> UX Designer (User Research, Prototyping, Visual Design, Interactions, Testing)</p>

				<h2>01. Research</h2>
				<p>Before I began prototyping, I spent some time collecting information from Touch of Modern employees, vendors, and competitors to get a better sense of how to approach this redesign.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Challenge</h4>
				<p>The current partner page is dull and does not showcase exactly how beneficial it is for vendors to partner with us. The partner page also lacks clear instructions on how to partner with us and what that process looks like.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Goal</h4>
				<p>Update the partner page to clearly describe who we are, what we do, and how we will work with them. This should ultimately lead to an increase in potential vendors. The solution should be a clean, minimalistic, and easy-to-read layout that allows users to easily navigate through the entire page.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Audience</h4>
				<p>Vendors, new entrepreneurs looking for distribution options (some are familiar with Touch of Modern, some are new to Touch of Modern)</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<p>It is important to look at what other companies are doing and determine their strengths and weaknesses. I looked into three companies: Ebay, Zulily, and Indiegogo. </p>

				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="proj-text">
				<h2>02. Analysis</h2>
				<p>After analyzing the data, I was able to narrow down the specific information we needed to include on the partner page. I presented my findings to the Director of Sales and finalized the page to include the following elements:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Who
						<ul>
							<li>Intro about us</li>
							<li>Facts about us</li>
						</ul>
					<li>What
						<ul>
							<li>Description of what we do</li>
						</ul>
					<li>How
						<ul>
							<li>Description of our work process</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Partners we’ve worked with
						<ul>
							<li>Success stories</li>
							<li>Reviews/quotes from vendors</li>
						</ul>
					<li>How to apply to be a vendor</li>
					</ul>
			</div>

				<h2>03. Design</h2>
				<h4 class="gray">Paper Prototype</h4>
				<p>To begin, I started out by drawing the framework on paper to get a sense of how things would look. It allowed me to see which layout worked best.</p>		
				<div class="center">
					<a href="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Sketches.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="Sketches">
						<img src="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Sketches.jpg" class="images"></img>
					</a>
					<div class="gray fineprint">Low-Fidelity Prototype</div>
				</div>
				<h4 class="gray">Low-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
				<p>After reviewing my sketches, I decided to pick the design that makes the page less text heavy. The goal is to get the vendors to contact us via the form at the bottom. By displaying too much text and unimportant details, it will hinder them from getting to the bottom quickly. As seen in the low-fidelity prototype below, I tried to make everything concise so they can easily get the information they need and start filling out the form. At this step, I started to involve the stakeholders to gather some quick feedback.</p>
				<div class="center">
					<a href="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Wireframe.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="Low-Fidelity Prototype">
						<img src="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Wireframe.jpg" class="images"></img>
					</a>
					<div class="gray fineprint">High-Fidelity Prototype</div>
				</div>
				<h4 class="gray">High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
				<p>After gathering some feedback, I moved onto the high-fidelity prototypes and focused more on the details. I came up with a few more options for each section. Each of them focus on displaying the information in a concise, yet clean way.</p>
				<div class="center">
					<a href="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Desktop-Versions.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="Prototype for Desktop Web">
						<img src="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Desktop-Versions.jpg" class="images"></img>
					</a>
					<div class="gray fineprint">Prototype for Desktop Web</div>
				</div>
				<p>After a few more rounds of feedback, we ended up with the following design. The final design displays the content in a more exciting way so that the vendors don’t feel overwhelmed with all the information given. For example, with the huge amount of information in the “Our Team” section, we wanted to make it feel more interactive by giving it a timeline animation effect. Here is a glimpse of the final product:</p>
				<div class="center">
					<a href="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Flow.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="User Flow">
						<img src="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Flow.jpg" class="images"></img>
					</a>
					<div class="gray fineprint">User Flow</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="proj-text">
				<h2>04. Test &amp; Reflect</h2>
				<p>During the implementation and QA stage, I worked closely with the engineers to ensure that the implementation was as close as possible to the final design. Any bugs and issues were tracked on a Google sheet to ensure all of them get fixed. We also tested it internally with all employees to find and fix any missed bugs before releasing the final version to the public.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Results</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Stakeholders were very happy with the result as the new partner page increased the amount of potential vendors.</li>
					<li>It also reduced the amount of back and forth between our sales team and vendors because the form at the bottom helped gather all the necessary information ahead of time.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 class="gray">Lessons learned</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Animations can be good if used effectively.</li> 
					<li>Constantly check in with different teams to ensure their parts are done in time so it doesn’t cause any delays for design team.</li> 
					<li>It’s good to provide copywriters with a character limit early to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth edits.</li> 
				</ul>
				<h4 class="gray">Next Steps</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Create marketing for partner page - send emails, display ads, etc.</li>
					<li>Add an awards section.</li>
					<li>Create a more detailed page for vendors to further talk about their success stories with us and show detailed statistics.</li>
				 </ul>
