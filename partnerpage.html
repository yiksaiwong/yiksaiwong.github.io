				<h1>TOMO Partner Page Redesign</h1>
				<p>Touch of Modern (TOMO) is an e-commerce experience for modern men to discover curated, well-crafted products. We partner with a variety of brands to market and sell their incredible products on the site. The goal of this project was to redesign the existing partner page to clearly display our information to potential vendors and increase the chances of them partnering with us.</p>

				<h2>01. Research</h2>
				<p>Before I began prototyping, I spent some time collecting information from Touch of Modern employees, vendors, and competitors to get a better sense of how to approach this redesign.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Challenge</h4>
				<p>The current partner page is dull and does not showcase exactly how beneficial it is for vendors to partner with us. The partner page also lacks clear instructions on how to partner with us and what that process looks like.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Goal</h4>
				<p>Update the partner page to clearly describe who we are, what we do, and how we will work with them. This should ultimately lead to an increase in potential vendors. The solution should be a clean, minimalistic, and easy-to-read layout that allows users to easily navigate through the entire page.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Audience</h4>
				<p>Vendors, new entrepreneurs looking for distribution options (some are familiar with Touch of Modern, some are new to Touch of Modern)</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<p>It is important to look at what other companies are doing and determine their strengths and weaknesses. I looked into three companies: Ebay, Zulily, and Indiegogo. </p>

				<h2>02. Analysis</h2>
				<p>After analyzing the data, I was able to narrow down the specific information we needed to include on the partner page. I presented my findings to the Director of Sales and finalized the page to include the following elements:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Who
						<ul>
							<li>Intro about us</li>
							<li>Facts about us</li>
						</ul>
					<li>What
						<ul>
							<li>Description of what we do</li>
						</ul>
					<li>How
						<ul>
							<li>Description of our work process</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Partners we’ve worked with
						<ul>
							<li>Success stories</li>
							<li>Reviews/quotes from vendors</li>
						</ul>
					<li>How to apply to be a vendor</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>03. Design</h2>
				<h4 class="gray">Paper Prototype</h4>
				<p>To begin, I started out by drawing the framework on paper to get a sense of how things would look. It allowed me to see which layout worked best.</p>
				<div class="center">
					<img src="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Sketches.jpg" class="images"></img>
				</div>
				<h4 class="gray">Low-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
				<p>I moved onto the low-fidelity prototype to see how the framework would look digitally. At this step, I involved the stakeholders to gather some quick feedback.</p>
				<div class="center">
					<img src="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Wireframe.jpg" class="images"></img>
				</div>
				<h4 class="gray">High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
				<p>I then moved onto the high-fidelity prototypes and focused more on the details.</p>
				<div class="center">
					<img src="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Desktop-Versions.jpg" class="images"></img>
					<div class="gray fineprint">Prototype for Desktop Web</div>
				</div>
				<p> After a few more rounds of feedback, the final version was created with distinct sections that clearly enables users to find all the information they need to partner with us. Here is a glimpse of the final product:</p>
				<div class="center">
					<img src="images/PartnerPage/PartnerPage_Flow.jpg" class="images"></img>
					<div class="gray fineprint">User Flow</div>
					<p>Want to interact with the final product?</p>

				<h2>04. Test &amp; Reflect</h2>
				<p>QA with engineers and other employees was done to ensure that the implementation was as close as possible to the final design. We also tested it internally with all employees to find and fix any bugs before releasing the final version to the public.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">Lessons learned</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Animations can be good if used effectively.</li> 
					<li>Constantly check in with different teams to ensure their parts are done in time so it doesn’t cause any delays for design team.</li> 
					<li>It’s good to provide copywriters with a character limit early to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth edits.</li> 
				</ul>
				<h4 class="gray">Future Plans</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Create marketing for partner page - send emails, display ads, etc.</li>
					<li>Add an awards section.</li>
					<li>Create a more detailed page for vendors to further talk about their success stories with us and show detailed statistics.</li>
				 </ul>
