				<h1>TOMO Holiday Store Design</h1>
				<p>Every holiday season at Touch of Modern (TOMO), an e-commerce website for modern men, we make holiday shopping less of a chore by creating a persona-based gift guide ("The Holiday Store") that runs from Aug to Dec. The goal of this project was to increase the purchase rate and product revenue by creating a new design for the holiday store that clearly displays each persona and the types of products offered to.</p>

				<h2>01. Research + Analysis</h2>
				<p>Since this was a recurring project, I reviewed the past designs to see what worked and what didn‚Äôt. I also spent time talking to TOMO employees to get their feedback on previous Holiday Store designs.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">üòê Challenges</h4>
				<p>The previous designs lacked real-life product shots that clearly told users which type of products were offered in each category. The design also blended in with the sales so users could easily ignore it. Additionally, there wasn‚Äôt an emphasis on how quickly we could ship the items offered in the holiday store.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">üéØ Goals</h4>
				<p>Design a holiday store for the homepage, hub, and individual stores that incorporates lifestyle photos while keeping a clean and polished design that stands out from the rest of the sales.</p>
				<h4 class="gray">üë®‚Äçüëß Audience</h4>
				<p>New and old customers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mainly men in their 30‚Äôs</li>
					<li>Women looking for holiday gifts</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 class="gray">üîé Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<p>To get a deeper understanding of how the holiday season works for other e-commerce companies, I took some time to look at the user flow and design of some competitors.</p>

				<h2>02. Design</h2>
				<h4 class="gray">üß≠ Explorations</h4>
				<p>After analyzing the data gathered from talking to coworkers and researching the competitors, I narrowed the list down to the following main changes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Feature actual product images related to each store</li>
					<li>Incorporate animation for featured stores on homepage to make them feel different from our sales</li>
					<li>Add the expected delivery date to give users a sense of security that products will arrive on time</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A few designs were drafted with those changes in mind and these were shown to the stakeholders.</p>

					</a>
					<div class="gray fineprint">Draft Prototypes for Desktop Web</div>
				</div>
				<h4 class="gray">üòä Final Design</h4>
				<p>After reviewing the different iterations, we decided to pick the design that included the following elements:
			    </p>
				<ul>
					<li>More product-based - Cleaner and clearly showed users what was being offered in each persona</li>
					<li>No overlaying text on top of photos since it would be hard for users to see the products</li>
					<li>Animated transition between the personas to easily capture the users' attention</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>04. Test &amp; Reflect</h2>
				<h4 class="gray">üìù User Acceptance Test</h4>
				<p>After a few rounds of QA with the engineer, the holiday store was tested to ensure there were no bugs. A Google Sheet was also created to track any bugs or issues found.</p>
								<div class="center">
					<a href="images/HolidayStore/HolidayStore_QA.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="Quality Assurance Doc">

					</a>
					<div class="gray fineprint">Quality Assurance Doc</div>
				</div>				
				<h4 class="gray">üìä Results</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Although the holiday store improved product sales, it did not make a significant difference. Stakeholders were still happy with the design. However, we discussed some improvements for the future.</li>
				</ul>				
				<h4 class="gray">üí° Lessons Learned</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Animations can be difficult to explain to engineers. Always include mock up and specs (type of transition, transition time, opacity, etc.) of the animation.</li> 
					<li>Animation makes design stand out. However, it might not be enough. Try other ways to make the the design stand out from the rest of the site such as making it full-width and using brighter colors.</li>				
					<li>User testing would be helpful to see why the holiday store is not performing as well as we would‚Äôve liked.</li>
					<li>Be sure to carefully check the design on all screen sizes during QA to ensure that the design is responsive.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 class="gray">üìÖ Future Plans</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Perform user testing to analyze user behavior and to find any issues.</li>
					<li>Allow people to shop by price instead of just by persona.</li>
					<li>Try full width to make the holiday store stand out from sales.</li>
					<li>Include filters and sort by feature for the holiday store.</li>
