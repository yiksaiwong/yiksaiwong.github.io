				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Every holiday season at Touch of Modern (TOMO), an e-commerce website for modern men, we <b>make holiday shopping less of a chore by creating a persona-based gift guide ("The Holiday Store") that runs annually from August to December.</b>
				<br><br>
				The goal of this project was to <b>increase the purchase rate and product revenue.</b>
				<br><br>
				<strong>Responsibilities:</strong> User Research, Prototyping, Interaction Design, Visual Design, Quality Assurance Testing</p>

				<h2>01. Research & Analysis</h2>
				<h4>üòü Problems with the Current Holiday Store</h4>
				<p>Since this was a recurring project, I reviewed the past designs to see what worked and what didn‚Äôt. I also spent time talking to TOMO employees to solicit feedback on previous Holiday Store designs. From that, I found the following issues:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Previous designs lacked real-life product shots</b> that clearly told users which type of products were offered in each category</li> 
					<li><b>Design blended in with the sales</b> so users could easily ignore it</li>
					<li><b>Lack of emphasis on how quickly we could ship holiday store items</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>‚ú® Opportunities to Improve</h4>
				<p>As an effort to improve the holiday store and thus increase purchase rate and product revenue, I decided to implement the following changes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Incorporate lifestyle photos</b></li> 
					<li><b>Make it stand out from the sales section</b></li>
					<li><b>Include shipping dates</b></li>
				</ul>
				<h4>üîé Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<p>To gain a deeper understanding of how the holiday season works for other e-commerce companies, I took some time to look at the user flow and design of some competitors.</p>
				<div class="center">

					</a>
					<div class="gray fineprint">Competitive Analysis</div>
				</div>

				<h2>02. Design</h2>
				<h4>üß≠ Explorations</h4>
				<p>After analyzing the data gathered from talking to coworkers and researching the competitors, I narrowed the list down to the following main changes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Feature actual product images related to each persona-based store</b></li>
					<li><b>Incorporate animation for featured themed stores</b> on homepage to differentiate from our sales</li>
					<li><b>Add the expected delivery date</b> to give users a sense of security that their products will arrive in time for the holidays</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A few designs were drafted with those changes in mind and these were presented to the stakeholders.</p>

						<img src="images/HolidayStore/HolidayStore_Desktop-Versions.jpg" class="images"></img>
					</a>
					<div class="gray fineprint">Draft Prototypes for Desktop Web</div>
				</div>
				<h4>üòä Final Design</h4>
				<p>After reviewing the different iterations, we decided to pick the design that included the following elements:
			    </p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>More product-based</b></li>
					<li>Cleaner design that <b>clearly showed users what was being offered in each persona-based store</b></li>
					<li><b>No overlaying text on top of photos</b> since it would be hard for users to see the products</li>
					<li><b>Animated transition between the personas</b> to easily capture the users' attention</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>03. Quality Assurance</h2>
				<h4>üìù Quality Assurance Document</h4>
				<p>Doing a few rounds of QA with the engineer, the holiday store was tested to ensure there were no bugs. A Google Sheet was created to track any bugs or issues found.</p>
				<div class="center">

					<div class="gray fineprint">Quality Assurance Document</div>
				</div>

				<h2>04. Results & Takeaways</h2>	
				<h4>üìä Results</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Although the holiday store design improved product sales, it did not make a significant difference. Stakeholders were still happy with the design.</li>
				</ul>				
				<h4>üí° Lessons Learned</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Animations can be difficult to explain to engineers. Always include mock up and specs (type of transition, transition time, opacity, etc.) of the animation.</li> 
					<li>Animation makes design stand out, but it might not be enough. Try other ways to make the design stand out from the rest of the site such as making the holiday store full-width and using brighter colors.</li>				
					<li>User testing would be helpful to see why the holiday store is not performing as well as we would‚Äôve liked.</li>
					<li>Be sure to carefully check the design on all screen sizes during QA to ensure that the design is responsive.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>üìÖ Next Steps</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Perform user testing to analyze user behavior and to find any issues</li>
					<li>Allow people to shop by price instead of just by persona</li>
					<li>Try full width to make the holiday store stand out from sales</li>
					<li>Include filters and sort by feature for the holiday store</li>
				 </ul>
